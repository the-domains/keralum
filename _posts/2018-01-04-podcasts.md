  Maybe video is not for you. Maybe having your own radio show can give you more
  time to reach your customers. We don’t have a radio station. But, there’s
  always podcasting. If you can talk forever or have a face for radio, we can
  help you get started with podcasting. Broadcast to live audiences and keep
  archives of your episode.
