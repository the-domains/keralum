Photography and Video Production are highly-skilled arts. A lot of thought goes into selecting the right lens, proper lighting, backgrounds, aperture, ISO, shutter speed, and a bunch of other variables.

But you don't have time for that. You just want a picture or video that gets your point across. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! You get the shot. Cha-ching! The sales roll in.

Do you really want to spend thousands on pre-production meetings, storyboards, scripting, assistants, catering, and all that? No!

You have a simple idea. You have a special offer and need people to see it.

You can do, actually, we can do miracles with an iPad and some lights. Now, let's make you some money.
